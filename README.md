# rdg-and-fr
A C++ implementation of the robust discontinuous Galerkin (DG) method and the flux reconstruction schemes. This code focuses on the solution of compressible Euler equations and compressible Navier-Stokes equations in 3D space on unstructured hexahedral meshes. The parallelization is done by MPI + OpenMP + CUDA.

Code is under construction.

## TODO
- Curvilinear mapping to support curvilinear elements
- Support of AMR (adaptive mesh refinement)
