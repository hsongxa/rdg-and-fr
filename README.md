# flux-reconstruction-schemes
A modern C++ implementation of the Flux Reconstruction schemes parallelized with MPI + CUDA. This code solves the Euler equations and Compressible Navier-Stokes equations in 3D space on unstructured hexahedral meshes.

## TODO
- Support of AMR (adaptive mesh refinement)
- Support of meshes with mixed cell shapes (tet, hex, wedge, and pyramid)
